# üóÉÔ∏è Database Seed Generator Plugin (IntelliJ IDEA).

**db-seed-plugin** is a plugin for **IntelliJ IDEA** that generates synthetic data to populate database schemas.
It automatically introspects a schema, analyzes dependencies between tables, and produces a consistent SQL script, respecting primary keys,
foreign keys, and complex cycles. It is ideal for developers who need realistic and repeatable seeds for testing, demos, or development
environments.

This project is developed in **Java 17** with **Gradle 8.14**, applying a modern programming style: `record`, `switch` with `yield`, pattern
matching, functional programming with Streams, `Optional` to avoid nulls, extensive use of **Lombok** (`@Builder`, `@Slf4j`,
`@UtilityClass`), and Javadoc documentation in Spanish. The architecture is organized into clear layers:

- **action**: IntelliJ actions (`SeedDatabaseAction`, `GenerateSeedAction`).
- **config**: configuration persistence (`GenerationConfig`, `ConnectionConfigPersistence`).
- **db**: main engine with introspection (`SchemaIntrospector`), topological sorting (`TopologicalSorter`), data generation (
  `DataGenerator`), and SQL construction (`SqlGenerator`).
- **model**: immutable models (`Table`, `Column`, `ForeignKey`).
- **schema**: DSL for manually defining schemas (`SchemaDsl`, `SqlType`).
- **ui**: Swing/IntelliJ dialogs and screens (`SeedDialog`, `PkUuidSelectionDialog`, `SchemaDesigner`).

### üöÄ New Feature: Dynamic Drivers

In previous versions, the plugin only included fixed support for PostgreSQL or loaded many drivers into memory.
Now, when running the **Seed Database** action, the user can select the database engine from a configurable list in `drivers.json`.

- If the driver is not installed, the plugin automatically downloads it from **Maven Central** to `~/.dbseed-drivers/`.
- It is dynamically registered in the `DriverManager`, avoiding memory saturation with dozens of unnecessary JARs.
- Each driver comes with sample values for the JDBC URL, which speeds up the initial configuration.

Example of `drivers.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "PostgreSQL",
    "mavenGroupId": "org.postgresql",
    "mavenArtifactId": "postgresql",
    "version": "42.7.3",
    "driverClass": "org.postgresql.Driver",
    "sampleUrl": "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dbname"
  },
  {
    "name": "MySQL",
    "mavenGroupId": "com.mysql",
    "mavenArtifactId": "mysql-connector-j",
    "version": "8.3.0",
    "driverClass": "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver",
    "sampleUrl": "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname"
  },
  {
    "name": "SQL Server",
    "mavenGroupId": "com.microsoft.sqlserver",
    "mavenArtifactId": "mssql-jdbc",
    "version": "12.6.0.jre11",
    "driverClass": "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver",
    "sampleUrl": "jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=dbname"
  }
]
```

This way, the plugin is **lighter, more extensible, and always uses the correct driver**.

### üîß Main Functionality

- Schema introspection via `DatabaseMetaData`.
- Table sorting with Tarjan's algorithm to detect cycles.
- Synthetic data generation with [DataFaker](https://www.datafaker.net/) respecting PKs, FKs, uniqueness, and nullability.
- Heuristics to recognize column names like `email`, `name`, or `uuid`.
- Cycle handling with deferred constraints (`SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED`) or updates (`PendingUpdate`).
- Interactive selection of UUIDs in PKs through a UI dialog.
- Automatic opening of the generated SQL in the IntelliJ editor.
- Standalone visual schema designer to prototype tables and generate creation SQL.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Distribution

The build is done with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew clean buildPlugin
```

The plugin is packaged as a `.zip` in `build/distributions/`, which is the installable artifact in IntelliJ via **Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí
Install plugin from disk...**.

The **GitHub Actions** pipeline compiles the project on JDK 17/21, runs the tests, and automatically attaches the `.zip` as a downloadable
artifact in each published release.

### üìã Quick Example

1. Select the database driver from the list (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.).
    - If it is not installed, the plugin will download it automatically.
2. Configure the connection in the **SeedDialog** (JDBC URL, user, password, schema).
3. Mark the PKs you want to treat as UUIDs in the **PkUuidSelectionDialog**.
4. The plugin introspects the schema, generates data, and builds an SQL script like:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED;

INSERT INTO "users" ("id", "name", "email")
VALUES ('9f1c...uuid...', 'Alice Doe', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT INTO "orders" ("id", "user_id", "amount")
VALUES ('c7a3...uuid...', '9f1c...uuid...', 42.50);

COMMIT;
```

The file is automatically opened in an editor within IntelliJ, ready to be executed or exported.
